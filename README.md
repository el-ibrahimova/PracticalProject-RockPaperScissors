Game rules:
In this game computer and player will each randomly choose one of three hand signs: rock (made by making a fist), paper (made by laying your hand flat), or scissors (made by holding out two fingers to look like scissors). Both of them show their signs at the same time to see who will win. Here are the rules that determine which sign beats another:

Rock wins over scissors (because rock smashes scissors)

Scissors wins over paper (because scissors cut paper)

Paper wins over rock (because paper covers rock)

If both players show the same sign, the game finish with draw.
